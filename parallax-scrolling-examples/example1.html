 	   <h1> Creating Parallax Scrolling Websites </h1>
      
           <p> 
	          This is an example page. Read the correspoinding
	          <a href="http://www.taccgl.org/blog/parallax-scrolling.html">blog article</a> on
	          <a href="https://www.taccgl.org">www.taccgl.org</a>.
               
	       </p>
	   <p> Parallax scrolling adds a 3D effect to websites by scrolling objects
	       that are further away slower than objects in front.
	       This first simple example has a background image that scrolls
               slower than the text.
	   </p>

  	   
	   <p> This  is implemented using the computers 3D graphic
	       hardware.  It defines the background image to be a 3D object
	       located 1000 pixels behind the text. 
	           Also the virtual users
	       eye position moves down while scrolling down. 
	       This automatically
	       leads to the desired parallax scrolling effect. 
	       
	   </p>

    <div id="bgDiv" class="bgimage">
      <img  id="bgImg" src="../pic/CubeBack/CBUp.png">
    </div>

    <div id="textBlock2" class="page">
      <div class="textinpage">
	<h1> Please read the Commented Source Code of this Page  </h1>


	<p> Note that in this simple example the background is 
	    just an image. See  the taccgl
            <a href="http://www.taccgl.org">homepage</a>
	    for a full 3D background. </p>

	<p> You might have noticed that the background image shown 
	    in this first example is smaller than usual. This is 
	    because the image is declared to be 1000px further away
            from the users eye than the text and therefore it is 
	    perspectively shrinked. See <a href="example2.html">example2</a>
	    to overcome this problem.

             taccgl(TM) uses a fluent interface. Most methods return their objects
             so that it is possible to append subsequent methods calls using the 
             '.' operator. */
