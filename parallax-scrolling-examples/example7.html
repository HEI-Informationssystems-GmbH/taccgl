 	   <h1> Creating Parallax Scrolling Websites : Example 7</h1>
      
           <p> 
	          This is an example page. Read the correspoinding
	          <a href="http://www.taccgl.org/blog/parallax-scrolling.html">blog article</a> on
	          <a href="https://www.taccgl.org">www.taccgl.org</a>.
               
	       </p>
	   <p> 
	   </p>

  	   
	   <p> This example 7 is implemented using the computers 3D graphic
	       hardware.     
	       
	       
	   </p>
	    <p> This example page has two text blocks and a big
	       image. It demonstrates animations moving and rotating the text 
	       blocks. Shadows (performance and GPU permitting) and lighting automatically
               adapt.

	<h1> Please read the Commented Source Code of this Page  </h1>


	

	<p>  
	    
	    
	    Initially (without javascript) this page shows the first text block
            followed by the image and then the second text block.
	    The 3D animation declars the image to appear 5000px behind the 
            text plane and so scrolls more slowly. Therefore less space is
	    needed for the image and the second text block is moved upwards
	    using <br>'margin-top:-600px'.
	    
	    <p>In addition the first text block rotates away when scrolling down
            and the second text block flies in.
