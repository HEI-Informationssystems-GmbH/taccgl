 	   <h1> Creating Parallax Scrolling Websites : Example 3</h1>
      
           <p> 
	          This is an example page. Read the correspoinding
	          <a href="http://www.taccgl.org/blog/parallax-scrolling.html">blog article</a> on
	          <a href="https://www.taccgl.org">www.taccgl.org</a>.
               
	       </p>
	   <p> 
	       This third example demonstrates scrolling of more than one
	       element.
	   </p>

  	   
	   <p> This example 3 is implemented using the computers 3D graphic
	       hardware.  It defines the background image to be a 3D object
	       located 5000 pixels behind the text. 
	           Also the virtual users
	       eye position moves down while scrolling down. 
	       This automatically
	       leads to the desired parallax scrolling effect. 
	       
	   </p>

    </div>

    <div id="block1" class="block"> 
      This text block is 1000 px behind the normal text.
    </div>
    <div id="block2" class="block"> 
      This text block is 2500 px behind the normal text.
    </div>
    <div id="block3" class="block"> 
      This text block is 4000 px behind the normal text.
    </div>
    <div id="block4" class="block"> 
      This text block is 1000 px behind the normal text not resized.
    </div>
    <div id="block5" class="block"> 
      This text block is 2500 px behind the normal text not resized.
    </div>
    <div id="block6" class="block"> 
      This text block is 4000 px behind the normal text not resized.
    </div>    


    <div id="bgDiv" class="bgimage">
      <img  id="bgImg" src="../pic/CubeBack/CBUp.png">

    <div id="textBlock2" class="page">
      <div class="textinpage">
	<h1> Please read the Commented Source Code of this Page  </h1>


	<p> Note that in this simple example the background is 
	    just an image. See  the taccgl
            <a href="http://www.taccgl.org">homepage</a>
	    for a full 3D background. </p>

	<p>   This example scrolls various text boxes, which 
            are located at various distances behind the normal text plane. 
	    Consequently the elements shrink and scroll more slowly. 
	    On some of the elements shrinking is disabled.
            See <a href="example4.html">example 4</a>
	    for scrolling elements that are in front of the normal text plane.
