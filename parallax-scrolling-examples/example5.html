	   the right part of the image in case the screen/window is not wide enough.
	   (note that taccgl(TM) beta version currently can not do background images. 
	   The z-index:-1 makes the background image appear behind the other elements
           of the page and the position:relative is needed to make the zindex work.
	   The z-index declaration is needed only when taccgl or webgl(TM) is not working.

 	   <h1> Creating Parallax Scrolling Websites : Example 5</h1>
      
           <p> 
	          This is an example page. Read the correspoinding
	          <a href="http://www.taccgl.org/blog/parallax-scrolling.html">blog article</a> on
	          <a href="https://www.taccgl.org">www.taccgl.org</a>.
               
	       </p>
	   <p> 
	   </p>

  	   <div id="objPlaceholder2"></div>
	   <p> This example 5 is implemented using the computers 3D graphic
	       hardware.   <p> Various 3D objects are displayed in front
	       and behind the normal text plane.  Also the virtual users
	       eye position moves down while scrolling down. 
	       This automatically
	       leads to the desired parallax scrolling effect. 
	       <p>This results in a parallax 3D effect, since 3D objects
	       located closer to the users eye scroll faster than 3D
	       objects further away.
	   </p>
	   <p>The three spheres on the right have been resized 
	       to take exacly the same screen space. This means that 
	       the spheres closer to the user are smaller in the 
               3D world than the spheres further away.

	<p>  
	    
	    3D objects can be placed on HTML pages 
            using an appropiate 3D library, e.g. 
	    <a href="http://www.taccgl.org">taccgl&trade;</a>. 
            You need a 3D model created with 
	    a 3D modelling program, put the model files on your
            web server and give the file url to the library.
	    <p> In addition you need to put a placeholder HTML element
            on the page, which marks the position where the 
            3D object will be placed.
