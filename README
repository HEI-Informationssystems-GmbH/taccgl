W A R N I N G    B E T A   Software

This is BETA Software and known to contain bugs. It is probably
not implemented completely and will probably not run on all
browsers and client computers. It will switch off itself on
certain client computers and browsers. In addition some client
computers might run animations slowly, animations may appear
choppy or jumpy, or even client computers might get overloaded or
even crash. 


M E D I C A L     W A R N I N G   
Note that taccgl allows you to add fast flashing and video game like animations to web pages. A small percentage of 
the population may experience epileptic symptoms when exposed to such animations. You might want to, or you may even 
be required to, add / show an epileptic warning message on your web site before showing such animations and you might 
want to or you may even be required to avoid certain types of animations on your web site. Please protect yourself 
when programming animations and protect the users of your web site and take the following warning message seriously:  

EPILEPSY WARNING, READ BEFORE VIEWING THE FOLLOWING ANIMATIONS,                                             
BEFORE USING A VIDEO GAME SYSTEM, BEFORE PROGRAMMING, WATCHING AND PUTTING ANIMATIONS ONLINE                
                                                                                                                 
MEDICAL RESEARCH INDICATES A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THE POPULATION MAY EXPERIENCE EPILEPTIC SEIZURES OR SEIZURE-LIKE 
SYMPTOMS  EXPOSED TO CERTAIN STIMULI, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LIGHT PATTERNS, FLASHING LIGHTS OR CERTAIN   
PATTERNS OF BACKGROUND ON A TELEVISION SCREEN, OR VIDEO MONITOR. EXPOSURE TO THESE STIMULI WHILE PLAYING VIDEO GAMES
OR WATCHING ANIMATIONS MAY INDUCE AN EPILEPTIC SEIZURE OR SEIZURE LIKE SYMPTOMS IN THESE INDIVIDUALS. CERTAIN   
CONDITIONS MAY INDUCE EPILEPTIC SYMPTOMS EVEN IN PERSONS WHO HAVE NO PRIOR HISTORY OF SEIZURES OF EPILEPSY. IF YOU 
EXPERIENCE ANY OF THE FOLLOWING SYMPTOMS WHILE PLAYING A VIDEO GAME OR WATCH ANIMATIONS --- DIZZINESS, ALTERED VISION,
