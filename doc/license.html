<h1> Beta Software </h1>

<p>
This is BETA Software and known to contain bugs. It is probably
not implemented completely and will probably not run on all
browsers and client computers. It will switch off itself on
certain client computers and browsers. In addition some client
computers might run animations slowly, animations may appear
choppy or jumpy, or even client computers might get overloaded or
even crash.

<h1> Epilepsy Warning </h1>

M E D I C A L     W A R N I N G   <br>
<p>
      Note that taccgl allows you to add fast flashing and video game like animations to web pages. A small percentage of 
      the population may experience epileptic symptoms when exposed to such animations. You might want to, or you may even 
      be required to, add / show an epileptic warning message on your web site before showing such animations and you might 
      want to or you may even be required to avoid certain types of animations on your web site. Please protect yourself 
      when programming animations and protect the users of your web site and take the following warning message seriously:
</p>

<p>
   EPILEPSY WARNING, READ BEFORE VIEWING THE FOLLOWING ANIMATIONS,                                                
   BEFORE USING A VIDEO GAME SYSTEM, BEFORE PROGRAMMING, WATCHING AND PUTTING ANIMATIONS ONLINE                   
   MEDICAL RESEARCH INDICATES A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THE POPULATION MAY EXPERIENCE EPILEPTIC SEIZURES OR SEIZURE-LIKE
   SYMPTOMS  EXPOSED TO CERTAIN STIMULI, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LIGHT PATTERNS, FLASHING LIGHTS OR CERTAIN   PATTERNS OF BACKGROUND ON A TELEVISION SCREEN, OR VIDEO MONITOR. EXPOSURE TO THESE STIMULI WHILE PLAYING VIDEO GAMES
    OR WATCHING ANIMATIONS MAY INDUCE AN EPILEPTIC SEIZURE OR SEIZURE LIKE SYMPTOMS IN THESE INDIVIDUALS. CERTAIN
