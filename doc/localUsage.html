This is BETA Software and known to contain bugs. It is probably
not implemented completely and will probably not run on all
browsers and client computers. It will switch off itself on
certain client computers and browsers. In addition some client
computers might run animations slowly, animations may appear
choppy or jumpy, or even client computers might get overloaded or
even crash. 


      M E D I C A L     W A R N I N G   
      Note that taccgl allows you to add fast flashing and video game like animations to web pages. A small percentage of 
      the population may experience epileptic symptoms when exposed to such animations. You might want to, or you may even 
      be required to, add / show an epileptic warning message on your web site before showing such animations and you might 
      want to or you may even be required to avoid certain types of animations on your web site. Please protect yourself 
      when programming animations and protect the users of your web site and take the following warning message seriously:  
 
"     EPILEPSY WARNING, READ BEFORE VIEWING THE FOLLOWING ANIMATIONS,                                                       "+
"     BEFORE USING A VIDEO GAME SYSTEM, BEFORE PROGRAMMING, WATCHING AND PUTTING ANIMATIONS ONLINE                          "+
"                                                                                                                           "+ 
"     MEDICAL RESEARCH INDICATES A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THE POPULATION MAY EXPERIENCE EPILEPTIC SEIZURES OR SEIZURE-LIKE     "+
"     SYMPTOMS  EXPOSED TO CERTAIN STIMULI, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LIGHT PATTERNS, FLASHING LIGHTS OR CERTAIN       "+
"     PATTERNS OF BACKGROUND ON A TELEVISION SCREEN, OR VIDEO MONITOR. EXPOSURE TO THESE STIMULI WHILE PLAYING VIDEO GAMES  "+
"     OR WATCHING ANIMATIONS MAY INDUCE AN EPILEPTIC SEIZURE OR SEIZURE LIKE SYMPTOMS IN THESE INDIVIDUALS. CERTAIN         "+
"     CONDITIONS MAY INDUCE EPILEPTIC SYMPTOMS EVEN IN PERSONS WHO HAVE NO PRIOR HISTORY OF SEIZURES OF EPILEPSY. IF YOU    "+
"     EXPERIENCE ANY OF THE FOLLOWING SYMPTOMS WHILE PLAYING A VIDEO GAME OR WATCH ANIMATIONS --- DIZZINESS, ALTERED VISION,"+
"     EYE OR MUSCLE TWITCHES, LOSS OF AWARENESS, DISORIENTATION, AND INVOLUNTARZ MOVEMENT OR CONVULSIONS ---                "+
"     IMMEDIATELY DISCONTINUE USE AND CONSULT YOUR PHYSICAN BEFORE PLAY OR WATCHING ANIMATIONS.                             ";

<p> Typically some examples and some images do not work if you are using the library locally (i.e. with "file://" URLs). 
  Please click on the link below to check if the 3D-Torus appears. </p>

<p> <a href="javascript:torus();">3D-Torus</a> </p>

<p> If this does not work and you are accessing the library locally (i.e. with "file://" URLs)
  we very much recommend to install a local web server (e.g. the chrome extension "Web Server for Chrome")
  and then access the library with "http://".
</p>

<p> For file URLs to work with a webkit browser, e.g. chrome, you need
  to set some options. This has some security implications, so make
  sure to read the documentaion of the option or better resort to a
  local web server.</p>

<p> In order to set the options you need to restart chrome with the options (it is not sufficient to 
    just start a new Chrome window in parallel with an already running chrome).
    To apply the options it is easiest to copy the chrome desktop icon, then to open
    the context menu with the right mouse button, select "Properties" and then to append
    the options to the program name e.g.
<p style="margin-left:40px">
    <tt> "C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe"  --allow-file-access-from-files  </tt>

<p> Note that the installation path of chrome might vary on your system.</p>

<p> You can also start chrome from a command window using these options, however starting from the 
    "run" entry in the windows start menu might not work.
